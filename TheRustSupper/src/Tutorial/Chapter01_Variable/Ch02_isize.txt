What is usize and isize? 
 * The usize type is an unsigned integer type with the same number of bits as the platform's pointer type.
  * The size of isize and usize of 32-bit architecture = 32-bit 
  * The size of isize and usize of 64-bit architecture = 64-bit 

What is a word?
 * The processer read one word at the time. (It does not read one bit at the time.)
  * 32-bit processer access 4 bytes at the time.
  * 64-bit processer access 8 bytes at the time.
 * usize always big enough to hold any pointer or any offset in a data structure.

What is processer?
 * A processor (CPU) is the logic circuitry that responds to and processes the basic instructions that drive a computer.
